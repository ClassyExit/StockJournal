# Stock Journal

## Project Information

This project was developed using the Vue.js framework. The stock journal is a log that records trades. By recording your trades, you can reflect upon previous trades and evaluate future trades. There are currently two main features: the stock trade log and a watchlist.

The main idea behind it was to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application. 

### Website
